# Premier-TACO is a Few-Shot Policy Learner: Pretraining Multitask Representation via Temporal Action-Driven Contrastive Loss

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in our project! We are excited to share our developments and progress with the community.

## Coming Soon

We are currently in the process of preparing our resources for release. This will include:

- **Pretraining Code:** The complete set of scripts and instructions needed to pretrain the encoder model.
- **Data:** The datasets used during the pretraining phase.
- **Pretrained Model-Checkpoints:** Access to the checkpoints of the model pretrained by us, allowing you to directly leverage our pretraining encoder for downstream few-shot imitation learning.

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your patience and support!
